# Conditionals and Optionals

## Conditionals

- Allows you run code based on specific conditions

- `if` statements
  - Executes code if condition is true
  - Includes `else` block if condition is false

## Switch Statements

- `switch` statements work similar to `if` statements but are easier to read
- If a value is not matched, the switch statement returns the `default` value

## Optionals

- Optionals allow you to declare a variable then assign a value later.
- Append `?` to end of type name to define as optional
  - `var username: String?`
